   /**
    * Keyboard input
    *
    * Working with the keyboard is easy in Excalibur. You can inspect
    * whether a button was just [[Keyboard.wasPressed|pressed]] or [[Keyboard.wasReleased|released]] this frame, or
    * if the key is currently being [[Keyboard.isHeld|held]] down. Common keys are held in the [[Input.Keys]]
    * enumeration but you can pass any character code to the methods.
    *
    * Excalibur subscribes to the browser events and keeps track of
    * what keys are currently held, released, or pressed. A key can be held
    * for multiple frames, but a key cannot be pressed or released for more than one subsequent
    * update frame.
    *
    * ## Inspecting the keyboard
    *
    * You can inspect [[Engine.input]] to see what the state of the keyboard
    * is during an update.
    *
    * It is recommended that keyboard actions that directly effect actors be handled like so to improve code quality:
    * ```ts
    * class Player extends ex.Actor {
    *   public update(engine, delta) {
    *     
    *     if (engine.input.keyboard.isHeld(ex.Input.Keys.W) ||
    *         engine.input.keyboard.isHeld(ex.Input.Keys.Up)) {
    *       
    *       player._moveForward();
    *     }
    *      
    *     if (engine.input.keyboard.wasPressed(ex.Input.Keys.Right)) {
    *       player._fire();
    *     }
    *   }
    * }
    * ```
    * ## Events
    * You can subscribe to keyboard events through `engine.input.keyboard.on`. A [[KeyEvent]] object is
    * passed to your handler which offers information about the key that was part of the event.
    *
    * - `press` - When a key was just pressed this frame
    * - `release` - When a key was just released this frame
    * - `hold` - Whenever a key is in the down position 
    *
    * ```ts
    * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("press", (evt: KeyEvent) => {...});
    * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("release", (evt: KeyEvent) => {...});
    * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("hold", (evt: KeyEvent) => {...});
    * ```
