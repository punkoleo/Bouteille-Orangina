    * Loadables

    * An interface describing loadable resources in Excalibur. Built-in loadable
    * resources include [[Texture]], [[Sound]], and a generic [[Resource]].
    *
    * ## Advanced: Custom loadables
    *
    * You can implement the [[ILoadable]] interface to create your own custom loadables.
    * This is an advanced feature, as the [[Resource]] class already wraps logic around
    * blob/plain data for usages like JSON, configuration, levels, etc through XHR (Ajax).
    *
    * However, as long as you implement the facets of a loadable, you can create your
    * own.
