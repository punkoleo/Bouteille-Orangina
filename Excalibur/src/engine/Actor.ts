  /**
   * Actors
   *
   * The most important primitive in Excalibur is an `Actor`. Anything that
   * can move on the screen, collide with another `Actor`, respond to events, 
   * or interact with the current scene, must be an actor. An `Actor` **must**
   * be part of a [[Scene]] for it to be drawn to the screen.
   *
   * ## Basic actors
   *
   * For quick and dirty games, you can just create an instance of an `Actor`
   * and manipulate it directly.
   *
   * Actors (and other entities) must be added to a [[Scene]] to be drawn
   * and updated on-screen.
   *
   * ```ts
   * var player = new ex.Actor();
   *
   * // move the player
   * player.dx = 5;
   *
   * // add player to the current scene
   * game.add(player);
   *
   * ```
   * `game.add` is a convenience method for adding an `Actor` to the current scene. The equivalent verbose call is `game.currentScene.add`.
   * 
   * ## Actor Lifecycle
   * 
   * An [[Actor|actor]] has a basic lifecycle that dictacts how it is initialized, updated, and drawn. Once an actor is part of a 
   * [[Scene|scene]], it will follow this lifecycle.
   * 
   * ![Actor Lifecycle](/assets/images/docs/ActorLifeCycle.png)
   *
   * ## Extending actors
   *
   * For "real-world" games, you'll want to `extend` the `Actor` class.
   * This gives you much greater control and encapsulates logic for that
   * actor.
   *
   * You can override the [[onInitialize]] method to perform any startup logic
   * for an actor (such as configuring state). [[onInitialize]] gets called
   * **once** before the first frame an actor is drawn/updated. It is passed
   * an instance of [[Engine]] to access global state or perform coordinate math.
   *
   * **TypeScript**
   *
   * ```ts
   * class Player extends ex.Actor {
   *
   *   public level = 1;
   *   public endurance = 0;
   *   public fortitude = 0;
   *
   *   constructor() {
   *     super();
   *   }
   *
   *   public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
   *     this.endurance = 20;
   *     this.fortitude = 16;
   *   }
   *
   *   public getMaxHealth() {
   *     return (0.4 * this.endurance) + (0.9 * this.fortitude) + (this.level * 1.2);
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * **Javascript**
   *
   * In Javascript you can use the [[extend]] method to override or add
   * methods to an `Actor`.
   *
   * ```js
   * var Player = ex.Actor.extend({
   *
   *   level: 1,
   *   endurance: 0,
   *   fortitude: 0,
   *   
   *   onInitialize: function (engine) {
   *     this.endurance = 20;
   *     this.fortitude = 16;
   *   },
   *   
   *   getMaxHealth: function () {
   *     return (0.4 * this.endurance) + (0.9 * this.fortitude) + (this.level * 1.2);
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ## Updating actors
   *
   * Override the [[update]] method to update the state of your actor each frame.
   * Typically things that need to be updated include state, drawing, or position.
   *
   * Remember to call `super.update` to ensure the base update logic is performed.
   * You can then write your own logic for what happens after that.
   *
   * The [[update]] method is passed an instance of the Excalibur engine, which
   * can be used to perform coordinate math or access global state. It is also
   * passed `delta` which is the time in milliseconds since the last frame, which can be used
   * to perform time-based movement or time-based math (such as a timer).
   *
   * **TypeScript**
   *
   * ```ts
   * class Player extends Actor {
   *   public update(engine: ex.Engine, delta: number) {
   *     super.update(engine, delta); // call base update logic
   *   
   *     // check if player died
   *     if (this.health <= 0) {
   *       this.emit("death");
   *       this.onDeath();
   *       return;
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * **Javascript**
   *
   * ```js
   * var Player = ex.Actor.extend({
   *   update: function (engine, delta) {
   *     ex.Actor.prototype.update.call(this, engine, delta); // call base update logic
   *
   *     // check if player died
   *     if (this.health <= 0) {
   *       this.emit("death");
   *       this.onDeath();
   *       return;
   *     }
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ## Drawing actors
   *
   * Override the [[draw]] method to perform any custom drawing. For simple games,
   * you don't need to override `draw`, instead you can use [[addDrawing]] and [[setDrawing]]
   * to manipulate the [[Sprite|sprites]]/[[Animation|animations]] that the actor is using.
   *
   * ### Working with Textures & Sprites
   *
   * Think of a [[Texture|texture]] as the raw image file that will be loaded into Excalibur. In order for it to be drawn
   * it must be converted to a [[Sprite.sprite]].
   * 
   * A common usage is to load a [[Texture]] and convert it to a [[Sprite]] for an actor. If you are using the [[Loader]] to
   * pre-load assets, you can simply assign an actor a [[Sprite]] to draw. You can also create a 
   * [[Texture.asSprite|sprite from a Texture]] to quickly create a [[Sprite]] instance.
   *
   * ```ts
   * // assume Resources.TxPlayer is a 80x80 png image
   *
   * public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
   *
   *   // set as the "default" drawing
   *   this.addDrawing(Resources.TxPlayer);
   *
   *   // you can also set a Sprite instance to draw
   *   this.addDrawing(Resources.TxPlayer.asSprite());
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Working with Animations
   *
   * A [[SpriteSheet]] holds a collection of sprites from a single [[Texture]].
   * Use [[SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]] to easily generate an [[Animation]].
   *
   * ```ts
   * // assume Resources.TxPlayerIdle is a texture containing several frames of an animation
   *
   * public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
   *   
   *   // create a SpriteSheet for the animation
   *   var playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(Resources.TxPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80);
   *
   *   // create an animation
   *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(engine, 120);
   *
   *   // the first drawing is always the current
   *   this.addDrawing("idle", playerIdleAnimation);
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Custom drawing
   *
   * You can always override the default drawing logic for an actor in the [[draw]] method, 
   * for example, to draw complex shapes or to use the raw 
   * [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D|Canvas API]].
   * 
   * Usually you should call `super.draw` to perform the base drawing logic, but other times
   * you may want to take over the drawing completely.
   *
   * ```ts
   * public draw(ctx: Canvas2DRenderingContext, delta: number) {
   *
   *   super.draw(ctx, delta); // perform base drawing logic
   *
   *   // custom drawing
   *   ctx.lineTo(...);
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ## Actions
   *
   * You can use the [[ActionContext|Action API]] to create chains of
   * actions and script actors into doing your bidding for your game.
   *
   * Actions can be simple or can be chained together to create complex
   * AI routines. In the future, it will be easier to create timelines or
   * scripts to run depending on the state of your actor, such as an
   * enemy ship that is Guarding a path and then is Alerted when a Player
   * draws near.
   *
   * Learn more about the [[ActionContext|Action API]].
   *
   * ## Collision Detection
   *
   * By default Actors do not participate in collisions. If you wish to make
   * an actor participate, you need to switch from the default [[CollisionType.PreventCollision|prevent collision]]
   * to [[CollisionType.Active|active]], [[CollisionType.Fixed|fixed]], or [[CollisionType.Passive|passive]] collision type. 
   *
   * ```ts
   * public Player extends ex.Actor {
   *   constructor() {
   *     super();
   *     // set preferred CollisionType
   *     this.collisionType = ex.CollisionType.Active;
   *   }
   * }
   * 
   * // or set the collisionType 
   * 
   * var actor = new ex.Actor();
   * actor.collisionType = ex.CollisionType.Active;
   * 
   * ```
   * ### Collision Groups
   * TODO, needs more information.
   *
   * ## Traits
   *    
   * Traits describe actor behavior that occurs every update. If you wish to build a generic behavior 
   * without needing to extend every actor you can do it with a trait, a good example of this may be 
   * plugging in an external collision detection library like [[https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/|Box2D]] or 
   * [[http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/|PhysicsJS]] by wrapping it in a trait. Removing traits can also make your 
   * actors more efficient.
   * 
   * Default traits provided by Excalibur are [[Traits.CapturePointer|pointer capture]], 
   * [[Traits.CollisionDetection|tile map collision]], [[Traits.Movement|Euler style movement]], 
   * and [[Traits.OffscreenCulling|offscreen culling]].
   * 
   *

   * **Actor bounding boxes do not rotate**
